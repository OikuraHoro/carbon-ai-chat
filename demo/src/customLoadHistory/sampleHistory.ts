The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.\n\nAI can be categorized in several ways, but two common classifications are:\n\n1. **Narrow or Weak AI**: Designed and trained for a particular task. Virtual personal assistants like Siri and Alexa are examples of narrow AI.\n\n2. **General or Strong AI**: Possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across different domains, similar to human intelligence. This type of AI does not currently exist but is a goal of many AI researchers.",
